  <li>following the angle of the triangle, find a point 3/4 of the way to the faredge and make a slice towards you</li>
  <li>continue doing this every few centimeters, around halfway you should start to transition towards a perpendicular cut, continue this cut until you reach the end of the sheet</li>
  <li>place the pickled daikon longways on the far left of the folded sheet, making sure it's even with the edge closest to you </li>
</ul>
