  <li>with your knife, use the <a href="www.savoryjapan.com/learn/techniques/katsuramuki.html"></a>katsuamuki technique to carefully remove the outer skin of the daikon; creating a smooth and even surface</li>

  <li>looking at where you just cut, find a point 3/4 of the way up and slice towards you, following the angle that the sheet of daikon provides</li>

  <li>continue doing this every few centimeters, around midway you should start to transition towards a perpendicular cut, continue this cut until you reach the end of the sheet</li>

  <li>on the left hand side place the pickled daikon parallel to your cuts, making sure it's even with the side closest to you </li>

  <li>tightly roll the sheet to the right making sure the unfolded edge stays even, at some point it may be easier to pick up the sheet and roll it in your hands</li>
